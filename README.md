## About

Simple and rapid Todo app in Laravel. Built with Laravel, Livewire, and Tailwind CSS. Including Breeze for out the box auth. 
Built as a test project to show the speed at which an auth project can be built with multi user support and segmented access to user data.

All in all this was about 1 hour of work.
